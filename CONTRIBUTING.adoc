== Navigating the code base

This plugin has been bootstrapped from the https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template[IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template].
It might be worth tracking upstream changes if they can be applied there too.

The whole project build is driven by Gradle as it is required to build the JetBrains plugin.
Currently, the Gradle JVM needs to be JDK 17+; this can also be configured in IntelliJ via
_Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | Gradle_.

.A note about the Excalidraw React Web App
JS and React are stranger things to me, their official documentation can be overwhelming at first;
I found the following https://medium.com/swlh/react-without-create-react-app-setting-up-a-dev-build-from-scratch-fefd5d9d6baa[blog post]
useful to introduce me to basic concepts.

On the same topic, here's a https://www.carlrippon.com/creating-react-app-with-typescript-eslint-with-webpack5/[blog post with the typescript angle].


=== Plugin code base

The `plugin` is a usual Gradle project, most of the sources are written in Kotlin.

TODO : describe `plugin.xml`, and package structure.

== Running the plugin in the sand-boxed environment

Use the predefined task `Run Plugin`, whose configuration is saved in the `.run` folder.

You can also use the Gradle command

[source,shell]
.Running the sandboxed IDE with the Excalidraw plugin
----
./gradlew :plugin:runIde
----

[TIP]
====
When running the sand-boxed IDE, the web-app path is overridden via these two system properties

* `excalidraw.internal.webappPath`, this is the path to the `index.html` file and the web-app support files (js, css, etc.)
* `excalidraw.internal.webappExcalidrawAssetsPath`, this is the path to the `excalidraw-assets` folder (containing excalidraw app itself and fonts).

Currently, these folders are configured in `excalidraw-assets/build.gradle.kts` to subfolders in the build directory

[source]
----
excalidraw-assets
├── build
│   ├── assets <1>
│   ├── react-build <2>
│   └── ...
└── ...
----
<1> Path passed to `excalidraw.internal.webappExcalidrawAssetsPath`
<2> Path passed to `excalidraw.internal.webappPath`

This allows modifying the web-app without having to rebuild the plugin.
However, at this time building the web-app still requires building / assembling the web-app.

In short, modify the web-app, then run:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew :excalidraw-assets:assembleFrontend
----

====


=== Plugin DEBUG logs

This plugin is using the diagnostic logger at DEBUG level, that means the log events
will be appended in the usual `idea.log`.

However, the log category has to be configured at DEBUG level, in order to do so

. Run the plugin configuration
. Once the sand-boxed IDE is ready, open _Help | Diagnostic Tools | Debug Log Settings..._
. Enter `#com.github.bric3.excalidraw`

The sand-boxed IDE's log file is located here : `plugin/build/idea-sandbox/system/log/idea.log`.

Once the sandbox has been run once, this configuration will appear in the following file under the following element:

.plugin/build/idea-sandbox/config/options/other.xml
[source,xpath]
----
/application/component[@name='PropertiesComponent']/property[@name='log.debug.categories']
----


=== Inspect UI

The (sand-boxed) IDE should be launched with internal mode enabled.

TIP: Toggle this in the _Help | Edit Custom Properties..._ and add `idea.is.internal=true`.

Then, to inspect the UI, use the _UI Inspector_.


Enable UI Inspector: _Tools > Internal Actions > UI > UI Inspector_




== Dependencies source code

Unfortunately, some dependency sources are not available, in particular `rd`.
This project was bumped to 2022.2, and gradle-intellij-plugin is now able to pull
the sources, which now embed the ones of JCef are embedded.

> If this is ever interesting to you, it's possible to clone sources of
[JetBrains/jcef](https://github.com/JetBrains/jcef). Whe running the app
one can use the JCEF type `org.cef.CefApp`, and get the version something along
`CefApp.getInstance().getVersion()` then check out the matching branch e.g. `git checkout cef-81.2.24`.

.JetBrains/rd
Part of this code is generated from C/C#, however types that are interacted with
are available in this https://github.com/JetBrains/rd[_rd_ project]. Since updating to 2022.2
the jar don't have the version in its name, so unsure about what's following but the releases
seems somewhat aligned to IntelliJ releases so https://github.com/JetBrains/rd/releases/tag/2022.2.5[2022.5]
then navigate the repo to the https://github.com/JetBrains/rd/tree/2022.2.5[associated tag].

- https://github.com/JetBrains/rd/blob/2022.2.5/rd-kt/rd-core/src/main/kotlin/com/jetbrains/rd/util/reactive/Interfaces.kt[IPropertyView]
- https://github.com/JetBrains/rd/blob/2022.2.5/rd-kt/rd-core/src/main/kotlin/com/jetbrains/rd/util/reactive/SourceEx.kt[IPropertyView extension methods]
- Lifetime or LifetimeDef types are generated.
